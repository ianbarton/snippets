I often capture code snippets using Emacs org-mode. Rather than keep them in
one or more org-files, I thought it would be more convenient to create a web
site, where it' easy to find snippets using tags, or a Google search.

I found most of these snippets on other people's web sites. I have tried to
credit the source, where I remembered to record it. However, if you find a
snippet that has no attribution and you think it's yours, please let me know
and I'll attribute it to you!

It's going to take a while to import all my existing snippets into the site,
but I'll get there eventually!
