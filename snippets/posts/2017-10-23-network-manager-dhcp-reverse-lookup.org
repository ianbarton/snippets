* Network Manager Dhcp Reverse Lookup
See: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#DHCP_problems_with_dhclient

It depends on the NetworkManager plugins used, whether the hostname is
forwarded to a router on connect. The generic "keyfile" plugin does
not forward the hostname in default configuration. To make it forward
the hostname, add the following to
/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf:

#+begin_src sh
[keyfile]
hostname=your_hostname
#+end_src
